# Effort translator

This is a very simple implementation of an effort translator. Why 'translator'?
The data is coming in the form of a codified string, like `d`, `D`, `q`, `Q` or `dDqQ`.
Each letter corresponds to an object containing a `status` and `effort`.
For more details, have a look at the `src/config.js`.
